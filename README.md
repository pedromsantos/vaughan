The library is now a [.NET Standard 2.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-standard-2-0/) compatible framework and [.NET Core 2.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-core-2-0/) (Only if you want to build the Unit Tests project).

## Getting started

### Online

Navigate to [repl.it](https://repl.it/FJHh/79) (a bit outdated and no SonicPi integration) there is some sample code included with the source. The SpeechToMusic module is not available as I have not found a way to add FParsec dependency in repl.it

### On your own environment

1. Clone the repository to your machine
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the repository folder
3. Restore dependencies using ```dotnet restore```
4. Build the project using ```dotnet build```
5. (optional) Execute the tests using ```dotnet test VaughanTests```
